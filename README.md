# zerotier-magisk
This magisk module enables you to start zerotier in the background after booting.

## Installation
if you're using a device with an older kernel where this version does not work, you can move to branch kernel-4.14 and installation steps are the same.

1. download zipped code file from github and unzip
2. modify zerotier/network and write down your own network id.
3. zip the files, remember to put all files in the root path of the zipped file.
4. install and enjoy.

### Scripts and binaries

all the scripts and binaries are placed in `/data/adb/zerotier/` ï¼Œ you can use termux to run them if needed.

`add_ip_rule.sh` is used to make the `main` route table, which zerotier writes its routes to, available.

### Build binaries yourself

Note that the zerotier binaries are only build for aarch64, you can build it yourself in termux.

Remember to delete `ZT_SSO_SUPPORTED=1` in `make-linux.mk` if you don't want to build zeroidc with rust.

Download libnatpmp library from http://miniupnp.free.fr/files/ and configure linking options in `make-linux.mk`

Or you can just download the source file modified by me in the zerotier branch, but be aware that it could be **OUTDATED**.
